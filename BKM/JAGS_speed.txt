Specifying a new prior distribution  

The 'zeros' trick at the prior level for a parameter theta  that is not part of the standard set.
A single zero Poisson observation (with mean phi = phi( theta )) contributes a term exp(-phi) to the likelihood for theta. 
When this is combined with a 'flat' prior for theta the correct prior distribution results.

         zero <- 0
         theta ~ dflat()
         phi <- expression for - log( desired prior for theta )
         zero ~ dpois(phi)

This is illustrated in new-prior by an example in which a normal prior is constructed using the zeros trick and the results are compared to the standard formulation.

It is important to note that this method produces high auto-correlation, poor convergence and high MC error, so it is computationally slow and long runs are necessary.
