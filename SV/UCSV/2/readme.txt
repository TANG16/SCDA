This zip file contains Matlab code for replicating the two empirical
applications in Chan (2016). The first tests if stochastic volatility
is needed in an unobserved components model for modeling inflation
in G7 countries. The second tests if the NAIRU is time varying in a
bivariate unobserved components model for inflation and unemployment.

The main files are main_UCSV.m and main_NAIRU.m.
